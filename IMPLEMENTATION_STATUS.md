## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Dynamic Model Architecture Support

**Problem:** ML service couldn't load models with different architectures (e.g., improved models with [256, 128, 64] vs original [128, 64, 32])

**Solution:**
- Read checkpoint metadata before model instantiation
- Extract `hidden_sizes` and `dropout` from checkpoint config
- Create model instance with correct architecture
- Load state_dict into properly sized model

**Code:**
```python
checkpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path, map_location='cpu')
config = checkpoint.get('config', {})
hidden_sizes = config.get('hidden_sizes', [128, 64, 32])
dropout = config.get('dropout', 0.2)

model = CryptoLSTM(
    input_size=INPUT_FEATURES,
    hidden_sizes=hidden_sizes,
    num_classes=3,
    dropout=dropout
)
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
```

**Impact:** Supports multiple model versions simultaneously without code changes
