## 1️⃣ MONITORING & ERROR TRACKING (P1)

### ✅ What Was Implemented

**Sentry Integration** (Already configured in `server.ts`):
```typescript
// Sentry initialization
if (process.env.SENTRY_DSN && config.env === 'production') {
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
    environment: config.env,
    tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
    integrations: [
      new Sentry.Integrations.Http({ tracing: true }),
      new Sentry.Integrations.Express({ app }),
    ],
  });
}
```

**Environment Variables Added**:
```bash
# Monitoring & Error Tracking (CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION)
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development
SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
SENTRY_ENABLE_TRACING=true

# Health Check & Monitoring
HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED=true
HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=60000
UPTIME_ROBOT_API_KEY=your-uptimerobot-api-key
```

**Health Check Endpoints** (Already implemented):
- ✅ `GET /health` - Main API health
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/health` - ML service health
- ✅ Redis connectivity check
- ✅ Database connectivity check

### 📊 Monitoring Stack

| Tool | Purpose | Cost | Setup Time |
|------|---------|------|------------|
| **Sentry** | Error tracking + APM | $26/mo | 15 min |
| **UptimeRobot** | Uptime monitoring | $7/mo | 10 min |
| **DataDog** (Optional) | Advanced APM | $15/host | 30 min |

### 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

```bash
# 1. Sign up for Sentry

## 5️⃣ LOAD TESTING (P5)

### ✅ What Was Implemented

**Load Testing Tool**: k6 (Grafana)

**Test Script**: `scripts/load-test.js` (Created)

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Smoke Test**: 1 user, 30 seconds (sanity check)
2. **Load Test**: 100 users, 5 minutes (normal load)
3. **Stress Test**: 500 users, 10 minutes (peak load)
4. **Spike Test**: 0→1000→0 users (traffic spike)
5. **Soak Test**: 50 users, 1 hour (stability)

**Metrics Tracked**:
```javascript
// k6 metrics
checks: pass rate (should be > 95%)
http_req_duration: response time (p95 < 500ms)
http_reqs: requests per second
http_req_failed: error rate (should be < 5%)
iterations: total test iterations
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Install k6
npm install -g k6

# Run smoke test
k6 run --vus 1 --duration 30s scripts/load-test.js

# Run load test
k6 run --vus 100 --duration 5m scripts/load-test.js

# Run stress test
k6 run --vus 500 --duration 10m scripts/load-test.js

# Generate HTML report
k6 run --out html=report.html scripts/load-test.js
```

**Expected Results** (Before Launch):
```
Smoke Test (1 user):
  ✓ All endpoints return 200 OK
  ✓ Response time < 100ms
  ✓ No errors

Load Test (100 users):
  ✓ 95% of requests < 500ms (p95)
  ✓ Error rate < 1%
  ✓ Throughput > 200 req/sec

Stress Test (500 users):
  ✓ System remains stable
  ✓ Error rate < 5%
