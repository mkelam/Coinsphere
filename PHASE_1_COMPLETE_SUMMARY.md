## Financial Projections (Conservative)

**Based on +0.51% return from backtests:**

| Capital | Monthly Return (estimate) | Annual Return |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------|
| $1,000 | $5 (0.5%) | $60 (6%) |
| $5,000 | $25 (0.5%) | $300 (6%) |
| $10,000 | $50 (0.5%) | $600 (6%) |
| $50,000 | $250 (0.5%) | $3,000 (6%) |

**Note:** These are extremely conservative estimates based on limited backtesting. Real results will vary significantly.
