## 1. Overview

### Mission Statement

### Support Philosophy

**Principles:**
1. **Community-First** - Empower users to help each other (Discord, Reddit)
2. **Transparency** - Admit mistakes, explain delays, share status updates
3. **Education Over Escalation** - Teach users to fish (knowledge base articles)
4. **Speed Matters** - Crypto moves fast, so should support (1-hour response time)
5. **Proactive Not Reactive** - Monitor for issues before users report them

**Values:**
- 🚀 **Speed** - Respond within 1 hour (critical issues: 15 minutes)
- 📚 **Education** - Every response teaches something new
- 🤝 **Empathy** - We understand crypto losses are stressful

## 5. Common Issues & Solutions

### 5.1 Exchange Sync Issues (30% of tickets)

**Issue:** "My Binance portfolio isn't syncing."

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. **Check API Key Permissions:**
   - Ensure "Read" permission is enabled
   - Binance: API Management → Edit Restrictions → Enable "Can Read"
2. **Verify API Key is Active:**
   - Some exchanges expire keys after 90 days
   - Regenerate key if expired
3. **Check IP Whitelist (if enabled):**
   - If user enabled IP whitelist on exchange, add Coinsphere IPs
   - Provide Coinsphere IP addresses: [list IPs]
4. **Re-Sync Manually:**
   - Settings → Exchanges → [Exchange Name] → Re-Sync
5. **Check Exchange Status:**
   - Is exchange API down? Check status page (e.g., Binance Status)

**If Still Failing:**
- Ask for error message screenshot
- Check Coinsphere status dashboard (are others reporting same issue?)
- Escalate to engineering if widespread

**Template Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

Sorry to hear your Binance sync isn't working! Let's troubleshoot:

1. Go to Binance → API Management → Edit your key
2. Ensure "Can Read" permission is enabled (NOT "Can Trade")
3. Save changes, then go to Coinsphere → Settings → Exchanges → Re-Sync

If that doesn't work, check if your API key has IP restrictions. If so, you'll need to whitelist our IPs: [list]

Let me know if this helps!
Coinsphere Support
```

### 5.2 Login Issues (15% of tickets)

**Issue:** "I can't log in. Wrong password error."

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. **Password Reset:**
   - Click "Forgot Password" on login page
   - Check email (including spam folder)
   - Reset link expires after 1 hour
2. **Check Email Typo:**
   - Ensure correct email address
   - Common mistake: gmail vs gmial
3. **OAuth Login (Google Sign-In):**
   - If signed up with Google, use "Continue with Google" button (not email/password)
4. **Account Exists Check:**
   - Verify account was created (check welcome email)
   - If no welcome email, account may not exist

**If Still Failing:**
- Check if account is locked (5+ failed login attempts → 15-min lockout)
- Verify email in database (admin panel)

**Template Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

Let's get you logged in:

1. Go to app.coinsphere.app/login
2. Click "Forgot Password"
3. Enter your email: [email]
4. Check your inbox (and spam folder) for reset link
5. Click link, set new password

**Note:** If you signed up with Google, use "Continue with Google" instead of email/password.

Still stuck? Reply with a screenshot and I'll investigate!

### 5.3 Prediction Accuracy Questions (20% of tickets)

**Issue:** "Your AI predicted BTC would go up, but it went down. Why?"

**Response Strategy:**
- Educate, don't defend
- Explain confidence scores and probabilities
- Emphasize transparency (we show accuracy history)

**Template Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

Great question! Our AI predictions are probabilities, not guarantees. Here's how to interpret them:

**Confidence Scores:**
- High (70%+): Strong signal, but still 30% chance of being wrong
- Medium (50-70%): Weak signal, coin flip territory
- Low (<50%): Very uncertain, don't trade on this

**Last Week's BTC Prediction:**
- Predicted: Bullish (65% confidence)
- Result: Bearish (-5%)
- Why? External shock (SEC lawsuit announcement)

**Our Overall Accuracy:**
- BTC (7-day): 72% correct (last 30 days)
- ETH (7-day): 68% correct (last 30 days)
- View full accuracy history: [link]

**Tip:** Use predictions as ONE signal, not the only signal. Always manage risk!

Hope this helps!

### 5.4 Billing Issues (10% of tickets)

**Issue:** "I was charged but my subscription isn't active."

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. **Check Payment Status:**
   - Settings → Billing → Subscription Status
   - If "Active" → Refresh page, clear cache
2. **Check Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Verify payment succeeded (not failed or refunded)
3. **Sync Issue (Rare):**
   - Webhook delay (Stripe → Coinsphere)
   - Manually activate subscription (admin panel)

**If Overcharged:**
- Issue refund immediately (no questions asked for first-time users)
- Apologize, explain what happened, prevent recurrence

**Template Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

I see you were charged $19.99 but your Pro subscription isn't showing as active. I've manually activated your subscription now.

**What Happened:**
Our payment webhook had a 10-minute delay (now fixed). You should see Pro features immediately.

**To Confirm:**
1. Refresh the app
2. Go to Settings → Subscription
3. You should see "Pro - Active"

As an apology, I've added 1 extra month free to your subscription. Thanks for your patience!

### 5.5 Feature Requests (15% of tickets)

**Issue:** "Can you add support for [Exchange X]?"

**Response Strategy:**
- Thank user for feedback
- Explain prioritization process (vote on roadmap)
- Set realistic expectations (don't promise timelines)

**Template Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for the suggestion! We'd love to add [Exchange X] support.

**How We Prioritize Features:**
We track all requests in our public roadmap: [link]. The most-voted features get built first.

**For [Exchange X]:**
Currently 15 users have requested this (ranked #8). We're targeting Q2 2026 for integration.

**Want to Speed It Up?**
1. Upvote the request: [roadmap link]
2. Share with friends who use [Exchange X]
3. Join our Discord to discuss: [discord link]

Appreciate the feedback!
Coinsphere Support
```

### 5.6 Risk Score Confusion (10% of tickets)

**Issue:** "Why does Bitcoin have a risk score of 35? It's the safest crypto!"

**Response Strategy:**
- Explain risk score is relative to ALL assets (not just crypto)
- BTC is "low risk" in crypto, but "medium-high risk" vs stocks/bonds

**Template Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

Great question! Risk scores are calculated relative to ALL asset classes (stocks, bonds, crypto).

**Risk Score Ranges:**
- 0-30: Very low risk (stablecoins, T-bills)
- 31-60: Low-medium risk (BTC, ETH, blue-chip stocks)
- 61-80: High risk (mid-cap altcoins, growth stocks)
- 81-100: Extreme risk (micro-caps, meme coins, penny stocks)

**Why BTC = 35:**
- Lower volatility than most altcoins (✅)
- Still 50-70% annual drawdowns (⚠️)
- Compared to S&P 500 (~15 risk), BTC is riskier

**Tip:** Use risk scores to balance your portfolio (mix low + high risk assets).

## 12. Escalation Procedures

### 12.1 Critical Incident Response

**Definition:** Critical incident = app down, data loss, security breach

**Step 1: Incident Detection (0-5 min)**
- Alert triggered (Datadog, Sentry, or user report)
- Support team creates #incident channel in Slack
- Notify on-call engineer (call + text)

**Step 2: Initial Assessment (5-15 min)**
- Engineer confirms severity (P0, P1, P2)
- Post status page update: "We're investigating reports of [issue]."
- Tweet: "We're aware of [issue]. Investigating now."

**Step 3: Mitigation (15 min - 4 hours)**
- Engineer works on fix
- Support team updates status page every 30-60 min
- Support team responds to incoming tickets: "We're aware and working on a fix. ETA: [time]."

**Step 4: Resolution (4 hours - 24 hours)**
- Engineer deploys fix
- Support team verifies resolution (test app)
- Post status page update: "Issue resolved. Root cause: [brief explanation]."
- Tweet: "All systems operational. Thanks for your patience!"

**Step 5: Post-Mortem (24-48 hours after resolution)**
- Write post-mortem (what happened, why, how we'll prevent it)
- Share publicly (blog post, Twitter thread)
- Email affected users with explanation and apology (offer credit if >6 hours downtime)

**Example Post-Mortem Tweet:**
```
🔍 Post-Mortem: Yesterday's 3-hour outage

What happened: Database migration script locked tables
Why: Inadequate testing in staging
Impact: 10,000 users couldn't sync portfolios
Fix: Rolled back migration, improved testing process

Sorry for the disruption. We've added safeguards to prevent this.
```

### 12.2 Security Incident Response

**Triggers:**
- Suspected data breach
- Unauthorized access to user account
- Leaked API keys
- Suspicious activity (mass account creation, scraping)

**Step 1: Containment (0-1 hour)**
- Disable affected accounts/API keys
- Block malicious IPs
- Rotate credentials if compromised

**Step 2: Investigation (1-24 hours)**
- Review logs (who accessed what, when)
- Determine scope (how many users affected)
- Contact security experts if needed

**Step 3: Notification (24-72 hours)**
- Email affected users: "We detected unauthorized access to your account. Please reset your password."
- Comply with GDPR (72-hour breach notification deadline)
- Post public statement if >1,000 users affected

**Step 4: Remediation (Ongoing)**
- Fix vulnerability
- Implement additional security measures
- Offer free identity monitoring if data leaked (e.g., Experian)
