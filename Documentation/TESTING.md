## 🛠️ Configuration

**File**: [playwright.config.ts](playwright.config.ts)

```typescript
{
  testDir: './e2e',
  workers: 1, // Sequential execution
  timeout: 30000,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  reporter: ['html', 'json', 'list'],
  webServer: [
    {
      command: 'cd backend && npm run dev',
      port: 3001,
      reuseExistingServer: true,
    },
    {
      command: 'cd frontend && npm run dev',
      port: 5173,
      reuseExistingServer: true,
    },
  ],
}
```

**Features:**
- Automatic backend/frontend server startup
- HTML, JSON, and list reporters
- Screenshot on failure
- Video recording on failure

---

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Prerequisites

Ensure both backend and frontend are running:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (headless)
npm test

# Run tests with browser visible
npm run test:headed

# Open Playwright UI
npm run test:ui

# View last test report
npm run test:report
```

### Individual Test Files

```bash
# Run only authentication tests
npx playwright test e2e/01-authentication.spec.ts

# Run only dashboard tests
npx playwright test e2e/02-dashboard.spec.ts

# Run only API tests
npx playwright test e2e/03-api-integration.spec.ts
```

---

## 📊 Test Results

### Initial Test Run Results:

**Summary:**
- Total Tests: 27
- Passed: 1 (4%)
- Failed: 9+ (issues detected)
- Status: Tests running but require UI implementation fixes

**Known Issues:**
1. Authentication pages may not have expected elements visible
2. Some dashboard components may not be rendering
3. Timeout issues on certain tests (30s default)

**Note**: Tests were written based on expected functionality. Frontend UI needs to match test expectations.

## 🐛 Debugging Failed Tests

### View Test Traces

```bash
# Generate trace
npx playwright test --trace on

# View trace
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run in debug mode with Playwright Inspector
npx playwright test --debug

# Run specific test in debug mode
npx playwright test e2e/01-authentication.spec.ts:17 --debug
```

### Screenshots & Videos

Failed test artifacts are saved in:
- `test-results/` - Screenshots and videos
- `playwright-report/` - HTML report with details

## ✅ Test Best Practices

### 1. Test Data Management
- Use unique timestamps in test emails: `e2e-test-${Date.now()}@coinsphere.com`
- Clean up test data after test runs (future enhancement)
- Use separate test database (future enhancement)

### 2. Assertions
- Wait for elements to be visible before interactions
- Use `expect().toBeVisible()` for UI elements
- Check API response structure and status codes
- Verify data types and value ranges

### 3. Timeouts
- Default timeout: 30s per test
- Use `{ timeout: 5000 }` for faster elements
- Increase timeout for slow operations (API calls, animations)

### 4. Page Object Model (Future)
- Consider extracting page selectors to Page Objects
- Centralize locators for maintainability
- Create reusable test utilities

---

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration (Future)

```yaml
name: E2E Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: npm test
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

- Different screen sizes
- Touch interactions

---

---

## 📝 Writing New Tests

### Test Template

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Setup code (e.g., login)
  });

  test('should do something', async ({ page }) => {
    // 1. Navigate
    await page.goto('/path');

    // 2. Interact
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: /click me/i }).click();

    // 3. Assert
    await expect(page.getByText(/success/i)).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Best Practices for New Tests:
1. Use descriptive test names
2. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
3. Use semantic locators (role, text, label)
4. Avoid hard-coded waits
5. Clean up test data
6. Handle async properly

---

## 🚀 Performance

### Current Performance:
- Test execution time: ~5 minutes for full suite
- Worker count: 1 (sequential execution)
- Timeout: 30s per test

### Future Optimizations:
- Increase workers for parallel execution
- Reduce test data creation overhead
- Use test fixtures
- Implement test database snapshots
- Cache authentication tokens
