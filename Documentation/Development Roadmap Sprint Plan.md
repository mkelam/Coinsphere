        "password": "SecurePass123!"
    })
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert "user" in response.json()

    )
    
    # 3. Verify response
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert "prediction" in data
    assert data["prediction"]["bull_market_price"] > 0
    
    # 4. Verify cached
