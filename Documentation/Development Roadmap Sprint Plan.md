---

#### NCB-06: Zero E2E Test Coverage 🟡
```
Severity: P1 - HIGH
Impact: No safety net, bugs will reach production
Status: Playwright configured but no test files exist
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create tests/ directory structure
  - tests/e2e/
  - tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts
  - tests/e2e/portfolio.spec.ts

**Assigned:** Frontend + Backend Developers
**ETA:** 3-4 hours
**Blockers:** NCB-02, NCB-04 (need those fixes first)

---

#### NCB-08: Portfolio Feature Route Not Accessible 🔴
```
Severity: P0 - CRITICAL BLOCKER
Impact: Core feature completely inaccessible
Test Results: 11/12 portfolio tests failing
Root Cause: Navigating to /portfolios redirects to /login
```

**Issue Description:**
After successful user signup and authentication, attempting to navigate to `/portfolios` route causes an automatic redirect to `/login`. This indicates either:
1. Route doesn't exist in App.tsx
2. Portfolio feature exists at different URL (e.g., `/portfolio`, `/dashboard`)
3. Auth guard too strict - authentication state not persisting
4. PortfolioPage component not created

**Evidence from E2E Tests:**
```
Error: Navigation to "http://localhost:5173/portfolios"
is interrupted by another navigation to "http://localhost:5173/login"

Failed Tests:
- TC-P02: Create new portfolio with name
- TC-P03: Create portfolio with initial asset
- TC-P04: Add asset to existing portfolio
- TC-P05: Display empty state when no portfolios exist
- TC-P06: Search/filter portfolios by name
- TC-P07: Delete portfolio with confirmation
- TC-P08: Display portfolio total value
- TC-P09: Calculate portfolio 24h change
- TC-P10: Show portfolio allocation breakdown
- TC-P11: Create and manage multiple portfolios
- TC-P12: Switch between portfolios
```

**Tasks:**

**Investigation Phase (30 minutes):**
- [ ] Check if /portfolios route exists in frontend/src/App.tsx
- [ ] Verify PortfolioPage component exists: `ls frontend/src/pages/`
- [ ] Test manual navigation: http://localhost:5173/portfolios
- [ ] Check router configuration for protected routes
- [ ] Review authentication context for route guards

**Fix Options:**

**Option A: Route Exists But Misconfigured (2-3 hours)**
- [ ] Fix route path if typo exists
- [ ] Update protected route guard logic
- [ ] Ensure auth state persists after navigation
- [ ] Add data-testid attributes to portfolio UI elements
- [ ] Re-run E2E tests

**Option B: Route Doesn't Exist - Build Feature (8-16 hours)**
- [ ] Create frontend/src/pages/PortfolioPage.tsx
- [ ] Implement portfolio listing UI
- [ ] Implement portfolio creation form
- [ ] Implement asset management (add/edit/delete)
- [ ] Add route to App.tsx with protection
- [ ] Style with Tailwind CSS (match design system)
- [ ] Add data-testid attributes
- [ ] Write component tests
- [ ] Re-run E2E tests

**Option C: Different Route Used (1 hour)**
- [ ] Identify correct route (check existing pages)
- [ ] Update E2E test BASE_URL in portfolio-management.spec.ts
- [ ] Verify tests pass with correct route
- [ ] Update documentation

**Assigned:** Frontend Lead + Full Team
**ETA:** 1-16 hours (depending on investigation outcome)
**Blockers:** None (can start immediately)
**Critical Path:** YES - Blocks full MVP launch

#### NCB-09: Authentication Test Infrastructure Issues 🟡
```
Severity: P2 - MEDIUM (Test Issues, Not App Bugs)
Impact: 3 authentication tests failing (but app works correctly)
Status: Verified - Application code is correct
```

**Issue Description:**
Three authentication E2E tests are failing due to test infrastructure issues, **NOT application bugs**. Manual testing and code review confirmed all auth features work correctly.

**Failed Tests (Application Working Correctly):**

**1. Test: "should show error for duplicate email"**
```
Error: page.evaluate: Execution context was destroyed,
most likely because of a navigation

Location: authentication.spec.ts:83
Root Cause: After signup, user is auto-authenticated and navigated
to /dashboard. Attempting to clear localStorage during navigation
destroys execution context.
```

**Fix:** Use separate browser contexts for test isolation
```typescript
// BEFORE (fails):
await page.waitForURL(/\/(dashboard|onboarding)/);
await page.evaluate(() => {
  localStorage.clear(); // ❌ Context destroyed during navigation
});

// AFTER (works):
test.describe('Duplicate Email', () => {
  test.use({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } });
  // Provides clean context without clearing during navigation
});
```

**2. Test: "should successfully login with valid credentials"**
```
Error: page.evaluate: Execution context was destroyed
Location: authentication.spec.ts:139
Root Cause: Same issue - clearing auth state while navigation happening
```

**Fix:** Wait for navigation to complete
```typescript
await page.waitForURL(/\/dashboard/, { timeout: 20000 });
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle'); // ✅ Wait for navigation
// Now safe to clear state if needed
```

**3. Test: "should show error for invalid credentials"**
```
Error: element(s) not found
Locator: div.bg-\[\#EF4444\]/10.text-\[\#EF4444\]
Location: authentication.spec.ts:177
Root Cause: CSS selector too specific - requires both classes
on same element, but Tailwind applies them differently
```

**Fix:** Use simpler, more reliable selectors
```typescript
// BEFORE (fails):
const errorMessage = page.locator('div.bg-\\[\\#EF4444\\]\\/10.text-\\[\\#EF4444\\]');

// AFTER (works) - Option 1: Text content
const errorMessage = page.getByText(/invalid credentials/i);

// AFTER (works) - Option 2: data-testid
const errorMessage = page.getByTestId('login-error-message');
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Fix duplicate email test - use separate browser context (15 min)
- [ ] Fix login test - use separate browser context (15 min)
- [ ] Fix invalid credentials test - update selector (15 min)
- [ ] Add data-testid="login-error-message" to LoginPage.tsx (5 min)
- [ ] Add data-testid="signup-error-message" to SignupPage.tsx (5 min)
- [ ] Re-run authentication tests - verify 12/12 passing

**Assigned:** Frontend Developer + QA
**ETA:** 1 hour
**Blockers:** None
**Priority:** P2 (Nice to have 100% auth test pass rate, but app works)

**Application Status:** ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING**
- Backend returns correct 401 errors with messages
- AuthContext properly propagates errors
- LoginPage displays errors correctly in red banners
- All manually tested and confirmed functional

---

#### NCB-10: Missing data-testid Attributes 🟡
```
Severity: P2 - MEDIUM (Code Quality)
Impact: E2E tests are brittle, use fragile CSS selectors
Status: Improvement needed for test reliability
```

**Issue Description:**
Many E2E tests use complex CSS selectors that are fragile and break easily. Adding `data-testid` attributes makes tests more reliable and maintainable.

**Current Selector Issues:**
```typescript
// Fragile CSS selectors:
page.locator('button, a').filter({ hasText: /create.*portfolio/i }).first()
page.locator('input[name="name"], input[placeholder*="name" i]').first()
page.locator('div.bg-\\[\\#EF4444\\]\\/10, div.text-\\[\\#EF4444\\]')

// Problems:
// - Complex escaping (\\ for special chars)
// - Multiple fallback selectors
// - Depends on implementation details (styling)
// - Breaks when CSS changes
```

**Recommended Approach:**
```typescript
// Stable data-testid selectors:
page.getByTestId('create-portfolio-button')
page.getByTestId('portfolio-name-input')
page.getByTestId('login-error-message')

// Benefits:
// ✅ Simple, readable
// ✅ Stable across refactors
// ✅ Explicit test contracts
// ✅ Easy to maintain
```

**Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Authentication Pages (30 minutes)**
- [ ] Add to LoginPage.tsx:
  ```tsx
  <div data-testid="login-form">
    <input data-testid="email-input" type="email" />
    <input data-testid="password-input" type="password" />
    <button data-testid="login-submit-button" type="submit" />
    <div data-testid="login-error-message" />
  </div>
  ```
- [ ] Add to SignupPage.tsx:
  ```tsx
  <div data-testid="signup-form">
    <input data-testid="firstname-input" name="firstName" />
    <input data-testid="lastname-input" name="lastName" />
    <input data-testid="email-input" type="email" />
    <input data-testid="password-input" name="password" />
    <input data-testid="confirm-password-input" name="confirmPassword" />
    <input data-testid="terms-checkbox" type="checkbox" />
    <button data-testid="signup-submit-button" type="submit" />
    <div data-testid="signup-error-message" />
  </div>
  ```

**Phase 2: Portfolio Pages (1 hour - once NCB-08 implemented)**
- [ ] Add to PortfolioPage.tsx:
  ```tsx
  <div data-testid="portfolios-page">
    <button data-testid="create-portfolio-button" />
    <input data-testid="portfolio-search-input" />
    <div data-testid="portfolio-list">
      <div data-testid="portfolio-card" />
    </div>
  </div>
  ```
- [ ] Add to Portfolio creation form:
  ```tsx
  <form data-testid="portfolio-form">
    <input data-testid="portfolio-name-input" />
    <textarea data-testid="portfolio-description-input" />
    <button data-testid="portfolio-submit-button" />
  </form>
  ```

**Phase 3: Dashboard & Other Pages (1 hour)**
- [ ] Add to DashboardPage.tsx
- [ ] Add to SettingsPage.tsx
- [ ] Add to AlertsPage.tsx

**Phase 4: Update E2E Tests (30 minutes)**
- [ ] Update authentication.spec.ts to use data-testid
- [ ] Update portfolio-management.spec.ts to use data-testid
- [ ] Remove fragile CSS selectors
- [ ] Re-run all tests

**Assigned:** Frontend Team
**ETA:** 3 hours total (can be done incrementally)
**Blockers:** NCB-08 (portfolio page needs to exist first for Phase 2)
**Priority:** P2 (Improves test reliability significantly)

---

#### NCB-11: Mobile Navigation Test Configuration Error 🟢
```
Severity: P3 - LOW (Quick Fix)
Impact: 17 mobile navigation tests cannot run
Status: Fix identified, simple implementation
```

**Issue Description:**
Mobile navigation test suite uses `test.use()` inside a `describe` block, which Playwright doesn't allow. This blocks 17 tests from running.

**Error Message:**
```
Cannot use({ defaultBrowserType }) in a describe group,
because it forces a new worker.
Make it top-level in the test file or put in the configuration file.

Location: mobile-navigation.spec.ts:22
```

**Current Code (INCORRECT):**
```typescript
// Line 22 - mobile-navigation.spec.ts
test.describe('Mobile Bottom Navigation', () => {
  test.use(iPhone12); // ❌ Not allowed inside describe block

  test('should display bottom nav', async ({ page }) => {
    // test code
  });
});
```

**Fix (CORRECT):**
```typescript
import { test, expect, devices } from '@playwright/test';

const iPhone12 = devices['iPhone 12'];

// ✅ Move test.use() to top level (BEFORE describe)
test.use(iPhone12);

test.describe('Mobile Bottom Navigation', () => {
  test('should display bottom nav', async ({ page }) => {
    // test code
  });
});
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Open frontend/tests/e2e/mobile-navigation.spec.ts
- [ ] Move line 22 `test.use(iPhone12)` to line 20 (before describe)
- [ ] Move line 303 `test.use(iPhone12)` to line 301 (if exists)
- [ ] Save file
- [ ] Run mobile navigation tests: `npx playwright test mobile-navigation.spec.ts`
- [ ] Verify 17/17 tests pass

**Assigned:** Frontend Developer
**ETA:** 5 minutes
**Blockers:** None
**Priority:** P3 (Low priority, easy fix, mobile testing)

## Lessons Learned (October 11, 2025 Update)

### What We Discovered from E2E Testing

After completing all 7 original critical blockers (CB-01 through CB-07), comprehensive end-to-end testing revealed important lessons:

**Key Insights:**

1. **Code ≠ Working Product**
   - All features were implemented at code level with excellent architecture
   - But services wouldn't start and runtime issues blocked all testing
   - **Lesson:** Run integration tests continuously during development, not just at the end

2. **Financial Accuracy Is Non-Negotiable**
   - Decimal utility bugs would have caused $760M errors on large numbers
   - Portfolio calculations were off by $100
   - **Lesson:** Financial applications require extra scrutiny on math operations

3. **Pre-existing Technical Debt**
   - 44 TypeScript compilation errors existed before our changes
   - These were ignored until they blocked deployment
   - **Lesson:** Address technical debt incrementally, don't let it accumulate

4. **Test Coverage Gaps**
   - Zero E2E tests despite Playwright being configured
   - Only 25% unit test coverage
   - 10 unit tests failing
   - **Lesson:** Testing should be part of feature development, not a separate phase

5. **Dependencies Matter**
   - PyTorch reported as unavailable despite being in requirements.txt
   - ML models not trained despite having training scripts
   - **Lesson:** Verify dependencies actually work in the target environment

### What Went Well

1. ✅ **Excellent Code Architecture**
   - All three expert reviewers praised the component structure
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Proper TypeScript usage

2. ✅ **Infrastructure Foundation**
   - PostgreSQL, Redis, ML service all running and healthy
   - Docker Compose configuration mostly correct
   - Security fundamentals (encryption, rate limiting) in place

3. ✅ **Frontend Build Success**
   - Vite production build works perfectly
   - wagmi v2 integration implemented correctly
   - Bundle size acceptable for crypto/Web3 app

4. ✅ **Documentation Quality**
   - 11 comprehensive markdown files created
   - Clear API specifications
   - Well-documented code

### What Needs Improvement

1. 🔴 **Runtime Testing**
   - Should have tested services starting earlier
   - Docker Compose issues should have been caught in Week 1
   - **Action:** Add "services running" as Day 1 success criteria

2. 🔴 **Continuous Integration**
   - No CI/CD pipeline running tests automatically
   - No automated build verification
   - **Action:** Set up GitHub Actions immediately after Sprint 0

3. 🔴 **Test-Driven Development**
   - Tests written after features (if at all)
   - No E2E tests until post-implementation
   - **Action:** Write tests BEFORE or DURING feature development

4. 🔴 **Financial Accuracy Validation**
   - Decimal utility not tested with large numbers
   - No edge case testing for financial calculations
   - **Action:** Add property-based testing for financial code

### Revised Best Practices

**Development Workflow:**
```
1. Write failing test
2. Implement feature
3. Verify test passes
4. Verify service runs locally
5. Commit code
6. CI runs all tests
7. Deploy to staging
```

**Daily Health Checks:**
```bash
# Run these every morning:
docker-compose ps              # All services up?
npm run build                  # Compiles?
npm test                       # Tests pass?
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Backend responding?
```

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Unit tests included?
- [ ] Integration test added?
- [ ] Tested locally (service runs)?
- [ ] Financial calculations verified?
- [ ] TypeScript compiles?
- [ ] No new test failures?

### Updated Risk Management

**New Risks Identified:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Services fail to start | **High** | **Critical** | Daily smoke tests, document setup |
| Financial calculation bugs | **Medium** | **Critical** | Extensive testing, peer review |
| Accumulated tech debt | **High** | **High** | Weekly debt sprints, strict code review |
| Test coverage inadequate | **High** | **High** | 70% coverage target, CI enforcement |
| Docker environment drift | **Medium** | **Medium** | Lock dependency versions, test containers |

### Timeline Impact

**Original Plan:** 8 weeks to MVP launch
**Actual Progress:** ~Week 5 equivalent (integration incomplete)
**Schedule Variance:** 6-8 weeks behind

**Revised Timeline:**
- Week 0 (NEW): Fix critical blockers (1 week)
- Week 1-2: Complete original Sprint 1-2 work
- Week 3-4: Complete original Sprint 3-4 work
- Week 5-6: Complete original Sprint 5-6 work
- Week 7: Integration & polish (extended)
- Week 8-9: Testing & launch (extended)

**New Launch Date:** Mid-December 2025 (9 weeks from now)

### Recommendations for Future Sprints

1. **Sprint 0 Must Complete Successfully**
   - All services running and healthy
   - All tests passing (0 failures)
   - Backend compiles without errors
   - Financial accuracy verified

2. **Add CI/CD Immediately After Sprint 0**
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated test runs on every PR
   - Automatic deployment to staging on merge

3. **Increase Test Coverage Gradually**
   - Every new feature must include tests
   - Target 70% coverage by Sprint 2
   - Add E2E tests for each user flow

4. **Weekly Technical Debt Sprints**
   - Friday afternoons: Fix one tech debt item
   - Don't accumulate more than 10 TypeScript errors
   - Keep test suite under 2 minutes runtime

5. **Daily Standups Must Include Health Checks**
   - "Are all services running?"
   - "Do all tests pass?"
   - "Any new blockers discovered?"

### Success Metrics (Updated)

**Sprint 0 Completion (Next Week):**
- [ ] All 7 new critical blockers (NCB-01 to NCB-07) resolved
- [ ] 100% services running (6/6 containers healthy)
