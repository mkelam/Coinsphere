## 🎨 UX/UI Design System

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Prioritize clear communication over aesthetic innovation
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Show only what's needed, when it's needed
3. **Trust through transparency** - Every prediction shows its accuracy history and reasoning
4. **Speed & responsiveness** - Crypto moves fast. Dashboard loads in <3 seconds
5. **Accessible by default** - Design for all users from the start (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Color Palette

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Primary | `#3B82F6` | Main brand color, CTAs |
| Secondary | `#8B5CF6` | Pro tier, secondary actions |
| Success | `#22C55E` | Low risk, positive changes |
| Warning | `#F59E0B` | Medium risk, cautions |
| Error | `#EF4444` | High risk, errors |

### Typography

- **Primary:** Inter (UI text, body copy)
- **Secondary:** Manrope (Headings, emphasis)
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono (Numerical data, API keys)

### Key Screens

1. **Dashboard** - Portfolio overview, quick actions, top holdings
2. **AI Predictions** - Bull/bear forecasts with transparency
3. **Risk Analysis** - Portfolio risk score and breakdown
4. **Asset Detail** - Deep dive with price charts and predictions
5. **Onboarding** - 5-minute exchange connection flow
6. **Settings** - Subscription management and preferences

## ⚠️ Critical Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: ML Model Accuracy Below 65%
- **Impact:** HIGH - Users lose trust, churn increases
- **Mitigation:** Start with BTC/ETH only, show historical accuracy, never promise >75%
- **Contingency:** Pivot to "market insights" vs "predictions"

### Risk 2: CoinStats Adds Prediction Features
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Loses differentiation
- **Probability:** LOW (12-18 months)
- **Mitigation:** Build stronger brand in transparency, lock in users with superior UX
- **Contingency:** Focus on niche (DeFi, NFT predictions)

### Risk 3: Bear Market = Low Engagement
- **Impact:** HIGH - Users stop checking portfolios
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (crypto cycles)
- **Mitigation:** Add "buy the dip" alerts, focus on risk management features
- **Contingency:** Introduce bear market-specific features (DCA calculator)

### Risk 4: Data Provider Costs Spiral
- **Impact:** HIGH - Unit economics break
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Mitigation:** Negotiate volume discounts at 10K users, build in-house aggregation by Month 12
- **Contingency:** Raise prices or reduce free tier limits

### Risk 5: Can't Reach 4.3% Conversion
- **Impact:** HIGH - Revenue misses target
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Mitigation:** A/B test paywall placement, add 14-day Pro trial, improve onboarding
- **Contingency:** Test paid-only model or freemium with 7-day trial
