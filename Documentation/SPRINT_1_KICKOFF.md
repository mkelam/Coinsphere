## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema Updates

**New Tables Required:**
```sql
-- Token watchlists (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE user_watchlists (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tokens(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  added_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  notes TEXT,
  UNIQUE(user_id, token_id)
);

-- Price update logs (monitoring)
CREATE TABLE price_update_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  update_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'scheduled', 'manual'
  symbols_updated INTEGER NOT NULL,
  symbols_failed INTEGER NOT NULL,
  duration_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,
  error_message TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Indexes to Add:**
```sql
-- Performance optimizations
CREATE INDEX idx_price_data_symbol_time ON price_data(symbol, timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_tokens_symbol ON tokens(symbol);
CREATE INDEX idx_tokens_market_cap ON tokens(market_cap_rank);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_watchlists_user ON user_watchlists(user_id);
```

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| CoinGecko API rate limits | High | Medium | Aggressive caching, backup data source |
| CI/CD setup complexity | Medium | Medium | Start simple, iterate gradually |
| Test coverage slips below 50% | Medium | High | Make tests required in PRs |
| Database migration issues | Low | High | Test migrations on fresh DB first |
| Team velocity lower than estimated | Medium | Medium | Prioritize must-haves, defer nice-to-haves |

### Mitigation Strategies

**CoinGecko Rate Limits:**
- Cache ALL responses for 5 minutes minimum
- Implement circuit breaker pattern
- Monitor API usage daily
- Have fallback mock data ready

**CI/CD Complexity:**
- Start with basic workflow (just tests)
- Add features incrementally
- Document every step clearly
- Get team buy-in early

**Test Coverage:**
- Make tests part of definition of done
- Review coverage in every PR
- Pair programming for complex tests
- Celebrate when coverage increases

---

## Daily Standup Format

**Every morning at 10:00 AM (15 minutes max)**

**Each team member answers:**
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. Any blockers or risks?

**Team reviews:**
- Are all services still healthy?
- Are tests still passing?
- Any new critical issues discovered?

**Example:**
```
Alice (Backend):
- Yesterday: Completed auth registration endpoint, 10 tests passing
- Today: Implement login endpoint and JWT generation
- Blockers: None

Bob (Backend):
- Yesterday: Started CoinGecko integration, basic client working
- Today: Add rate limiting and error handling
- Blockers: Need API key from product manager

Charlie (DevOps):
- Yesterday: Research GitHub Actions best practices
- Today: Create initial CI workflow file
- Blockers: Waiting for Bob's tests to be ready
```

## Sprint 1 Metrics (Track Daily)

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Test Coverage | 50% | TBD |
| Endpoints Implemented | 12 | 0 |
| TypeScript Errors | 6 | 6 |
| CI Pipeline Success | 100% | N/A |
| Services Healthy | 6/6 | 6/6 âœ… |
| Commit Frequency | 3+/day | TBD |

## Conclusion

Sprint 0 was a massive success, establishing a rock-solid foundation. Sprint 1 builds on this by implementing the core functionality that every feature depends on:
- **Authentication** - Identity and security
- **Price Data** - The lifeblood of the application
- **Token Management** - Organizing the crypto universe
- **CI/CD** - Ensuring quality at scale

With these pieces in place, Sprint 2 can focus on the exciting ML pipeline and prediction engine that makes Coinsphere unique.

**Let's ship it! ðŸš€**
