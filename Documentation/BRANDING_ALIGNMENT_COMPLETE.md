## Branding Changes Made

### Application Identity
- **Old Names:** CryptoSense Analytics Platform, CoinStats Enhanced, Crypto Scanner

- **Domain:** coinsphere.app
- **Tagline:** AI-powered crypto portfolio tracker with market predictions and risk scoring

### Database & Infrastructure

- **Database Name:** cryptosense_dev → **coinsphere_dev**
- **Docker Containers:** cryptosense-* → **coinsphere-***
- **Docker Network:** cryptosense-network → **coinsphere-network**

- **Frontend:** cryptosense-frontend → **coinsphere-frontend**
- **Backend:** cryptosense-backend → **coinsphere-backend**

### Repository

## Preserved References

The following references to "CoinStats" were **intentionally preserved** as they refer to the competitor company in competitive analysis sections:

- Business Requirements Document - competitive landscape analysis
- Product Strategy - market positioning vs CoinStats
- Go-to-Market Plan - competitor references

---

## Remaining Technical Debt

### Auto-Generated Files
- ✅ frontend/package-lock.json - Contains old naming in lockfile metadata (safe to ignore, will update on next npm install)

### Internal Development Files
- ✅ .claude/settings.local.json - Claude Code settings (non-critical)
- ✅ Documentation/REBRANDING_SUMMARY.md - Historical record created by agent (contains old names for reference)

These files are either auto-generated or internal documentation and do not affect the application branding.

---

## Verification

### Final Check Results
```bash
# Checked for remaining old branding
grep -ri "CryptoSense\|Crypto Scanner" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude=package-lock.json

# Results:
# - 0 critical occurrences in application code
# - Remaining references are in historical/auto-generated files only
```

### Docker Services Renamed
All Docker services now use **coinsphere-*** naming:
- coinsphere-postgres
- coinsphere-redis
- coinsphere-backend
- coinsphere-ml
- coinsphere-frontend
- coinsphere-adminer
- coinsphere-network

### Environment Variables Aligned
All environment variables now reference **coinsphere**:
- APP_NAME=Coinsphere
- DATABASE_URL=postgresql://coinsphere:password@localhost:5432/coinsphere_dev
- SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=alerts@coinsphere.app
