2. Hit limit ‚Üí Upgrade prompt
3. Plus conversion ‚Üí 4.3% target (realistic)
4. Upsell to Pro ‚Üí Higher value customers

**Recommendation:** Excellent pricing strategy. Consider adding annual plans (15% discount) for better retention.

#### ‚úÖ Growth Strategy

**Acquisition Channels:**
1. **Crypto Twitter** - Influencer partnerships, ML prediction demos
2. **Reddit** - r/CryptoCurrency, r/Bitcoin (avoid spammy marketing)
3. **Product Hunt** - Launch day, aim for #1 Product of the Day
4. **YouTube** - Tutorial videos, feature walkthroughs
5. **SEO** - "Best crypto portfolio tracker", "AI crypto predictions"

**Retention Strategy:**
1. **Daily predictions** - Email digest with top ML predictions
2. **Alert notifications** - Price/risk alerts drive daily engagement
3. **Portfolio tracking** - Sticky product (users don't want to re-enter holdings)
4. **Exchange sync** - Automated syncing = passive engagement

**Viral Loops:**
- Referral program (give 1 month Plus, get 1 month Plus)
- Social sharing (portfolio performance screenshots)
- Public portfolios (follow other traders)

**Assessment:** Solid growth strategy. Focus on Product Hunt launch and crypto Twitter for initial traction.

#### üîÑ Feature Gaps

**Not in MVP (By Design):**
- ‚ùå Tax reporting (TBD for Season 2)
- ‚ùå TradeFi integration (stocks, bonds)
- ‚ùå Institutional features (multi-user accounts)
- ‚ùå White-label solutions
- ‚ùå Mobile apps (PWA sufficient for MVP)

**Nice-to-Haves (Post-Launch):**
- üì± Native mobile apps (React Native)
- üìä Advanced analytics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
- ü§ñ Trading bots (automated buy/sell based on predictions)
- üí¨ Social features (follow traders, leaderboards)
- üéì Educational content (crypto investing guides)

**Recommendation:** Ship MVP as-is. Add features based on user feedback.
