### Week 7-8: Rigorous Backtesting (40 hours)

#### Testing Protocol

**1. Walk-Forward Analysis**
- Train on 6 months of data
- Test on next 3 months (out-of-sample)
- Move forward 3 months
- Repeat for entire dataset (2020-2025)
- Compare train vs. test performance (detect overfitting)

**2. Out-of-Sample Testing**
- Hold back 30% of data NEVER seen during optimization
- Final test on this data
- If performance drops >20% from backtest → overfit

**3. Monte Carlo Simulation**
- Randomize trade order 1000+ times
- Test robustness to sequence risk
- Calculate confidence intervals (90% of outcomes)

**4. Realistic Constraints**
- Transaction fees: 0.1-0.5% per trade
- Slippage: 0.5-2% (larger for bigger orders)
- Latency: 100-500ms execution delay
- Liquidity limits: Can't move >2% of 24hr volume

**5. Stress Testing**
- 2022 bear market performance
- March 2020 COVID crash
- May 2021 China mining ban
- FTX collapse (Nov 2022)
- How does strategy survive each?

---

#### Success Criteria (ALL must pass)

✅ **Sharpe ratio >1.5** in out-of-sample test
✅ **Maximum drawdown <20%**
✅ **Win rate within 10%** of expectation
✅ **Performance stable** across walk-forward periods
✅ **Survives stress test** scenarios
✅ **Monte Carlo 90% CI** is profitable

**If strategy fails any test:** Revise or discard. Don't rationalize or curve-fit.
