## 7. Known Issues & Risks

### Low Priority Issues

1. **pg_dump not in Windows PATH**
   - **Impact:** Backup script shows "command not found" on Windows dev environment
   - **Risk:** Low (production uses Docker with PostgreSQL client tools)
   - **Resolution:** Verify Docker image includes `pg_dump` before production deployment

2. **ML Service Not Running**
   - **Impact:** LSTM predictions unavailable
   - **Risk:** None (statistical predictions working perfectly)
   - **Resolution:** Deploy ML service in Week 2 (post-MVP enhancement)

3. **Multiple Backend Dev Servers Running**
   - **Impact:** 7 duplicate processes detected (process IDs vary)
   - **Risk:** Low (development environment only, not affecting functionality)
   - **Resolution:** Kill duplicate processes before deployment
