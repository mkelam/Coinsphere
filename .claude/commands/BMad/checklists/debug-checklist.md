# TypeScript/Next.js Debugging Checklist

## Purpose
Comprehensive checklist for systematic debugging of TypeScript and Next.js issues to ensure thorough investigation and resolution.

---

## Pre-Debugging Setup

### Environment Verification
- [ ] Verified Node.js version matches project requirements
- [ ] Verified npm/yarn/pnpm version is up to date
- [ ] Verified TypeScript version is compatible with project
- [ ] Verified Next.js version and compatibility
- [ ] Checked all dependencies are installed (`node_modules` exists)
- [ ] Reviewed `package.json` for any dependency conflicts
- [ ] Cleared cache (`rm -rf .next node_modules && npm install`)

### Configuration Review
- [ ] Reviewed `tsconfig.json` for correct settings
- [ ] Reviewed `next.config.js` for custom configurations
- [ ] Checked environment variables are set (`.env.local`)
- [ ] Verified path aliases are correctly configured
- [ ] Checked ESLint configuration (`.eslintrc`)
- [ ] Reviewed Prettier configuration if applicable

### Source Control
- [ ] Confirmed current branch and recent changes
- [ ] Checked if issue exists in main/master branch
- [ ] Identified when issue first appeared (git bisect if needed)
- [ ] Reviewed recent commits for suspicious changes

---

## Error Collection Phase

### Gather Error Information
- [ ] Captured full error message with stack trace
- [ ] Noted error code (e.g., TS2322) if TypeScript error
- [ ] Identified exact file, line, and column of error
- [ ] Determined when error occurs (dev/build/runtime)
- [ ] Documented steps to reproduce consistently
- [ ] Captured screenshots or video of issue
- [ ] Checked browser console for additional errors
- [ ] Reviewed server logs (terminal output)

### Context Collection
- [ ] Identified recent code changes related to error
- [ ] Checked if issue is intermittent or consistent
- [ ] Noted affected pages/components/routes
- [ ] Identified if issue is environment-specific
- [ ] Reviewed related GitHub issues or Stack Overflow
- [ ] Checked Next.js/TypeScript release notes for breaking changes

---

## TypeScript Error Analysis

### Type System Investigation
- [ ] Read and understood the error message completely
- [ ] Identified the expected type vs actual type
- [ ] Traced where the problematic value originates
- [ ] Checked type definitions (`.d.ts` files)
- [ ] Reviewed interface/type declarations involved
- [ ] Looked for missing or incorrect generic parameters
- [ ] Checked for implicit `any` types
- [ ] Verified import statements are correct

### Common TypeScript Issues
- [ ] Checked for `any` type escapes
- [ ] Looked for unsafe type assertions (`as`, `!`)
- [ ] Verified object property access is type-safe
- [ ] Checked array/tuple type usage
- [ ] Reviewed union/intersection type handling
- [ ] Verified generic constraints are satisfied
- [ ] Checked for circular type references
- [ ] Reviewed conditional type logic

### Type Inference Issues
- [ ] Checked if type widening is occurring unexpectedly
- [ ] Verified type narrowing in conditional blocks
- [ ] Reviewed discriminated union usage
- [ ] Checked if return types need explicit declaration
- [ ] Verified type guards are working correctly
- [ ] Reviewed mapped type transformations

---

## Next.js Specific Debugging

- [ ] Checked build output for warnings
- [ ] Reviewed `.next` folder for generated files
- [ ] Tested with `--debug` flag for verbose output
- [ ] Checked for circular dependencies
- [ ] Verified dynamic imports are configured correctly
- [ ] Reviewed webpack/turbopack configuration
- [ ] Checked for memory issues during build

### Runtime Issues
- [ ] Determined if error is server-side or client-side
- [ ] Checked Network tab for failed requests
- [ ] Reviewed API route implementation
- [ ] Verified middleware execution
- [ ] Checked for hydration mismatches
- [ ] Reviewed data fetching methods (getServerSideProps, etc.)
- [ ] Verified environment variables are accessible
- [ ] Checked for race conditions in async operations

### Server/Client Component Issues (App Router)
- [ ] Verified 'use client' directives are in correct files
- [ ] Checked that Server Components don't use client-only features
- [ ] Verified props passed to Client Components are serializable
- [ ] Reviewed Server Actions have 'use server' directive
- [ ] Checked async Server Components are properly awaited
- [ ] Verified no hooks are used in Server Components
- [ ] Reviewed component boundary separation

### Hydration Debugging
- [ ] Identified content that differs between server/client
- [ ] Checked for date/time rendering differences
- [ ] Looked for random value generation
- [ ] Verified no browser API usage during SSR
- [ ] Checked third-party script interference
- [ ] Reviewed CSS-in-JS library hydration
- [ ] Verified HTML structure validity
- [ ] Used `suppressHydrationWarning` appropriately

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Systematic Investigation
- [ ] Created minimal reproducible example
- [ ] Isolated the problem to specific code section
- [ ] Used binary search to narrow down issue
- [ ] Applied "5 Whys" technique to find root cause
- [ ] Distinguished between symptom and actual problem
- [ ] Identified contributing factors (environment, config, etc.)
- [ ] Documented hypothesis and tested it

### Code Review
- [ ] Reviewed code logic for correctness
- [ ] Checked for typos or naming mistakes
- [ ] Verified function signatures match usage
- [ ] Reviewed async/await patterns
- [ ] Checked error handling implementation
- [ ] Verified null/undefined checks
- [ ] Reviewed side effects and state mutations

---

## Solution Implementation

### Fix Development
- [ ] Designed fix that addresses root cause (not symptom)
- [ ] Considered multiple solution approaches
- [ ] Evaluated tradeoffs of each approach
- [ ] Selected appropriate solution with rationale

- [ ] Maintained or improved type safety
- [ ] Followed project coding standards
