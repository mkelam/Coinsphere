   - Never hardcode in source code

2. **Use environment-specific keys**
   - Testnet keys for development
   - Live keys only in production
   - Separate keys for different environments

3. **Restrict API permissions**
   - Binance: Only enable "Spot Trading" + "Read"
   - Never enable "Withdraw" permission
   - Whitelist IP addresses

4. **Rotate keys regularly**
   - Change every 3-6 months
   - Immediately if compromised
   - Keep old keys for 24h during transition

5. **Monitor API usage**
   - Check for unusual activity
   - Set up alerts for failed auth
   - Review API logs weekly
