## üîß HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (Should Fix Before Launch)

### P2-001: Remove Deprecated Test File (Legacy API Tests)
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Started
**Priority:** P2 - High
**Effort:** 5 minutes
**Assigned To:** Dev Team
**Sprint:** Pre-Launch Sprint

**Description:**
The file `e2e/03-api-integration.spec.ts` contains 6 failing tests that use the old API integration pattern without CSRF protection. These tests are superseded by `e2e/03-api-integration-fixed.spec.ts`.

**Failing Tests:**
1. ‚ùå should fetch tokens list
2. ‚ùå should fetch ML predictions for BTC
3. ‚ùå should fetch risk score for ETH
4. ‚ùå should create portfolio with authentication
5. ‚ùå should create alert with authentication
6. ‚ùå should handle token refresh

**Root Cause:**
Tests are making API calls without CSRF tokens, which are now required by the backend security middleware.

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Delete deprecated test file
rm e2e/03-api-integration.spec.ts

# Keep only the CSRF-protected version
# e2e/03-api-integration-fixed.spec.ts
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Delete `e2e/03-api-integration.spec.ts`
- [ ] Verify `e2e/03-api-integration-fixed.spec.ts` has equivalent coverage
- [ ] Run test suite and confirm all API tests pass
- [ ] Update test count documentation (46 ‚Üí 40 tests)

**Impact:**
- Reduces test noise from 7 failures to 1 failure
- Eliminates confusion about which tests are current
- Improves test pass rate from 84.8% to 90%

**Files to Change:**
- DELETE: `e2e/03-api-integration.spec.ts`

### P2-002: Add Error Handling E2E Tests
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Started
**Priority:** P2 - High
**Effort:** 4 hours
**Assigned To:** QA/Dev Team

- [ ] Malformed API responses
- [ ] Network disconnection during operation
- [ ] Rate limiting (429 errors)
- [ ] Authentication token expiration
- [ ] CSRF token expiration
- [ ] WebSocket connection failures
- [ ] Real-time update failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application must gracefully handle all error scenarios
- Users must see appropriate error messages
- Application must not crash or show blank screens
- Retry mechanisms must be tested

**Test File Location:** `e2e/07-error-handling.spec.ts`

**Estimated Test Count:** 10-12 tests

---

### P2-003: Add Edge Case E2E Tests
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Started
**Priority:** P2 - High
**Effort:** 5 hours
**Assigned To:** QA/Dev Team
**Sprint:** Sprint 2 (Post-Launch)

**Description:**
No tests exist for edge cases that could cause poor user experience or performance issues.

**Required Test Coverage:**
- [ ] Empty portfolio state (new user)
- [ ] Large portfolio (100+ assets)
- [ ] Large transaction history (500+ transactions)
- [ ] Special characters in inputs (', ", <, >)
- [ ] XSS attempt prevention
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (via API)
- [ ] Extremely long asset names
- [ ] Negative transaction amounts
- [ ] Zero-value portfolios
- [ ] Future dates in transaction history
- [ ] Concurrent user sessions (multiple tabs)
- [ ] Browser back/forward navigation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application must handle edge cases gracefully
- Performance must remain acceptable with large datasets
- Security measures must prevent injection attacks
- UI must not break with unusual inputs

**Test File Location:** `e2e/08-edge-cases.spec.ts`

**Estimated Test Count:** 12-15 tests

## üêõ MINOR BUGS (Nice to Fix)

### P3-001: Button Hover State Test Assertion Failure
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Started
**Priority:** P3 - Low
**Effort:** 2 minutes
**Assigned To:** Dev Team
**Sprint:** Pre-Launch Sprint (Quick Win)

**Description:**
Test expects `rgb()` color format, but modern browsers return `oklab()` color space. This is a test issue, not a design bug.

**Failing Test:**
`e2e/03-ux-fidelity.spec.ts:216` - Design System: Interactive States - Button Hover

**Error Message:**
```
Expected substring: "rgb"
Received string: "oklab(0.623018 -0.0332199 -0.185032 / 0.9)"
```

**Root Cause:**
Modern browsers use oklab color space for better color accuracy. Test assertion is too strict.

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// File: e2e/03-ux-fidelity.spec.ts:216
// Current (WRONG):
expect(hoverBg).toContain('rgb');

// Fixed (CORRECT):
expect(hoverBg).toMatch(/rgb|oklab/);
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Update test assertion to accept both `rgb` and `oklab` formats
- [ ] Run test and verify it passes
- [ ] Test pass rate improves to 87% (40/46) or 100% (40/40 after P2-001 fix)

**Files to Change:**
- EDIT: `e2e/03-ux-fidelity.spec.ts` (line 216)

**Impact:**
- Increases UX fidelity test pass rate from 90% to 100%
- Eliminates false positive test failure
