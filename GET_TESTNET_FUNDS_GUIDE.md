## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Testnet Limitations
- **Not Real Money:** All funds are virtual, have no real value
- **Reset Periodically:** Balances may reset every few weeks
- **Limited Assets:** Not all tokens available on testnet
- **No Withdrawals:** Can't withdraw testnet funds (they're not real)

### Testnet vs Live Differences
- Testnet has lower liquidity (fewer traders)
- Price movements may be different from live market
- Some features may be disabled
- Order book depth is limited

### Security
- Never use testnet API keys for live trading
- Keep testnet and live API keys separate
- Don't share your testnet API keys publicly
