## üìã Expected Behavior

### When a Token Enters Entry Window (24-48h Before Unlock)

**Example: ARB enters window on Oct 24**

1. **Signal Generation:**
   ```
   üì° Signal: BUY ARB/USDT
      Strength: 0.75
      Reasoning: Large unlock event in 36 hours (11% of supply)
      Status: ‚è≥ Pending execution
   ```

2. **Position Opening:**
   ```
   üíº Position: LONG ARB/USDT
      Entry Price: $1.250000
      Quantity: 800 ARB
      Position Size: $1,000 (10% of capital)
      Stop Loss: $1.212500 (-3%)
      Take Profit: $1.312500 (+5%)
   ```

3. **Position Monitoring:**
   - Market data streams real-time prices
   - P&L calculated continuously
   - Stop-loss monitored automatically
   - Take-profit monitored automatically

4. **Position Exit (3 Scenarios):**

   **Scenario A: Take-Profit Hit (+5%)**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Position CLOSED
   Entry: $1.250000
   Exit: $1.312500
   P&L: +$50.00 (+5.00%)
   Reason: Take-profit target reached
   ```

   **Scenario B: Stop-Loss Hit (-3%)**
   ```
   ‚ùå Position CLOSED
   Entry: $1.250000
   Exit: $1.212500
   P&L: -$30.00 (-3.00%)
   Reason: Stop-loss triggered
   ```

   **Scenario C: Exit at Unlock Time**
   ```
   üìÖ Position CLOSED
   Entry: $1.250000
   Exit: $1.230000
   P&L: -$16.00 (-1.60%)
   Reason: Unlock event occurred
   ```
